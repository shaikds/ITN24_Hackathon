Network Speed Test Application
Description
This repository contains a Python-based client-server application designed to perform network speed tests. The application compares UDP and TCP downloads to evaluate network performance under different conditions.

Features
Client-Server Architecture: Uses both UDP and TCP protocols to measure network speeds.
Concurrency Handling: Manages multiple network connections simultaneously using Python threading.
Dynamic Configuration: Users can specify the file size and the number of TCP and UDP connections.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Scapy (for packet manipulation)
Installation
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-speed-test.git
Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install scapy
Running the Application
Server
To start the server, run the following command from the root directory of the project:

bash
Copy code
python server.py
This will start the server and begin broadcasting UDP offers.

Client
To start the client, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python client.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to configure the download parameters.

Usage Example
Start the Server:
The server will print its IP address and start sending out UDP offer announcements.
Start the Client:
The client asks for the file size and the number of TCP and UDP connections before it starts listening for offers.
Once an offer is received, the client will connect to the server and begin the speed tests.
